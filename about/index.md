I am a [statistician](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/yukun-zhang/35/83b/892) living in Calgary, AB, Canada. 

My home city is [Tianjin](https://www.google.ca/search?q=tianjin&oq=tianjin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i61.900j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8), a beautiful metropolis in China. Tianjin is a livable and lovely city, however, I leave for Canada to pursue my career goal and create a better environment for my parents' later life.

I have a happy and warm family and I am well-loved by friends. My husband is a software developer. My parents come visit us almost every year.

I like travelling, my mom took me to the sea for the first time when I was 3 years old. It started my journey. I have been to around 10 provinces in China.

Since I came to Canada, we have been to almost 10 cities in the US and Canada. Halifax would be our next destination. We have a separate webpage to record all these journeys. 

I am currently crazy about data science. I am trying to learn more to equip myself.

This webpage would be used to post all the learning ideas/reviews. I hope this webpage would track my study and drive me move forward, always.
