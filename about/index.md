title: About Me

I am a [statistician](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/yukun-zhang/35/83b/892) living in Calgary, AB, Canada. 

My home city is [Tianjin](https://www.google.ca/search?q=tianjin&oq=tianjin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i61.900j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8), a beautiful metropolis in China. Tianjin is a livable and lovely city, however, I leave for Canada to pursue my career goal and create a better environment for my parents' later life.

I have a happy and warm family and I am well-loved by friends. My husband is a software developer. My parents come visit us almost every year.

I like travelling, my mom took me to the sea for the first time when I was 3. It started my journey. I have been to Beijing, and several places in Hebei, Anhui,Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Yunnan Province.

Since I came to Canada, we have been to Seattle, San Francisco, Orlando, San Diego, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax would be our next destination. We have a separate webpage to record all these journeys. 

I currently crazy about data science. I am trying to learn more to equip myself and take advantage of my software developer husband--he taught me how to use github and python soon :)

This webpage would be used to post all the learning ideas/reviews. I hope this webpage would track my study and drive me move forward, always.
