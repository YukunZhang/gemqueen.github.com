#### EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE

**Statistician**, 2015-Present

University of Calgary, Calgary    

- Providing data science consultation for clinicians in the methods of statistical analysis and interpretation of rich structured and highly unstructured medical record.

- Involving in architecture and implementation of cutting edge visual analytic solutions for physical activity data. Lead the design and implementation of new components and publish R packages with the
fundamental units of reproducible codes.

**Statistical Research Analyst**, 2014-2015

University of Calgary, Calgary

- Conducted advanced statistical analysis, simulation study and data management using R/SAS/SQL. Supervised co-workers within the research team regarding data management, data analysis and programming issues. Communicated with clinicians to translate ideas and provide consultation for study design and decision making.

- Presented research outcomes to audience with different backgrounds in departmental seminars and international conferences. Prepared technical report of data analyses for scientific presentations and research manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journal.

**Data Analyst**, 2013

Alberta Health Services, Calgary

- Involved in the project evaluated new biomarkers to identify patients who might at decreased risk of dying from lung cancer.

- Carried out all aspects of the statistical analyses from cleaning the clinical data set to recommending final models with the guidance of Dr. Karen Kopciuk, Research Scientist and Statistician.

- Applied Cox proportional hazard model to the data and selected the final multivariate models with the help of non-parametric methods (e.g. Kaplan Meier), multi-state models with analyses carried out using SAS and R. Wrote a non-technical summary of our finding from the preliminary, descriptive and regression modeling phases as well as model evaluation.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant** , 2012 - 2014

University of Calgary, Calgary

- Illustrated statistical tests, taught R programming and led students to read research papers. Cooperated with the instructor by giving constructive feedback to improve a newly created syllabus. Interacted tactfully to guide and encourage the students on their academic pursuit.
