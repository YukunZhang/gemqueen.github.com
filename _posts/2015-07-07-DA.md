**Discriminant Analysis**
-------------------------
LDA is a multivariate procedure for predicting group membership (PDA) and describing group separation (DDA) on a set of correlated variables. PDA focuses on the accuracy of classification. DDA uses discriminant function coefficients to rank order variables according to their contributions to group separation (Rencher, 2002)

An example of DA application is de Coster ed al. (2005) developed a classification rule for stroke patients using self-reported depression scores at 4 time point post stroke.
