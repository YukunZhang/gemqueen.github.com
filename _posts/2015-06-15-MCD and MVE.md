 The most widely used multivariate high breakdown method is the minimum volume ellipsoid (MVE) approach which seeks the ellipsoid of minimum volume containing at least half of the data. The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) approach uses instead the sample mean vector and covariance matrix of a fixed-size subset of the data, the cases in the subset being chosen to minimize the determinant.
